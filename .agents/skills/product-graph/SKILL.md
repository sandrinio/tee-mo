# Product Graph — Document Relationship Intelligence

## Purpose

This skill gives you instant awareness of all product planning documents and their relationships. Instead of globbing and reading every file in `product_plans/`, you read a single JSON graph that maps every document, its status, and how it connects to other documents.

## Three-Tier Loading Protocol

When you need to understand the product document landscape, load information in tiers — stop at the tier that answers your question:

### Tier 1: Graph JSON (~400-1000 tokens)
Read `.vbounce/product-graph.json` for a bird's-eye view.
- All document IDs, types, statuses, and paths
- All edges (dependencies, parent relationships, feeds)
- **Use when:** answering "what exists?", "what's blocked?", "what depends on X?"

### Tier 2: Specific Frontmatter (~200-500 tokens per doc)
Read the YAML frontmatter of specific documents identified in Tier 1.
- Ambiguity scores, priorities, tags, owners, dates
- **Use when:** you need details about specific documents (not the full set)

### Tier 3: Full Documents (~500-3000 tokens per doc)
Read the complete document body.
- Full specs, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, open questions
- **Use when:** creating or modifying documents, decomposing epics, or resolving ambiguity

## Edge Type Semantics

| Edge Type | Meaning | Direction |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `parent` | Document is a child of another (Story → Epic) | parent → child |
| `depends-on` | Document cannot proceed until dependency is done | dependency → dependent |
| `unlocks` | Completing this document enables another | source → unlocked |
| `context-source` | Document draws context from another | source → consumer |
| `feeds` | Document contributes to a delivery/release | document → delivery |

## When to Regenerate the Graph

Run `vbounce graph` (or `node .vbounce/scripts/product_graph.mjs`) after:
- **Any document edit** that changes status, dependencies, or relationships
- **Sprint lifecycle events** (sprint init, story complete, sprint close)
- **Planning session start** — ensure graph reflects current state
- **Document creation or archival** — new nodes or removed nodes

The graph is a cache — it's cheap to regenerate and stale data is worse than no data.

## Blocked Document Detection

A document is **blocked** when:
1. It has incoming `depends-on` edges from documents with status != "Done"/"Implemented"/"Completed"
2. It has `ambiguity: 🔴 High` and linked spikes are not Validated/Closed
3. Its parent document has status "Parking Lot" or "Escalated"

To find blocked documents:
1. Read the graph (Tier 1)
2. For each node, check its incoming `depends-on` edges
3. Look up the source node's status
4. If any source is not in a terminal state → document is blocked

## Impact Analysis

To understand what changes when you modify a document:
```bash
vbounce graph impact <DOC-ID>        # human-readable
vbounce graph impact <DOC-ID> --json # machine-readable
```

This runs BFS traversal and returns:
- **Direct dependents** — documents immediately affected
- **Transitive dependents** — documents affected through cascading dependencies
- **Upstream feeders** — documents that feed into the changed document
