FOLLOW THIS EXACT STRUCTURE. Output sections in order 1-4.

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Set status, last updated, and roadmap ref
2. **§1 Active Risks**: Table of open risks with phase, source, likelihood, impact, mitigation
3. **§2 Risk Analysis Log**: Phase-stamped entries appended on state transitions
4. **§3 Closed Risks**: Resolved/mitigated risks moved here
5. **§4 Change Log**: Auto-appended on updates

Risk Levels:
- Likelihood: Low / Medium / High
- Impact: Low / Medium / High / Critical

Risk Statuses: Open → Mitigating → Mitigated → Closed / Accepted

Output location: `product_plans/strategy/RISK_REGISTRY.md`

Document Hierarchy Position: LEVEL 6 — CROSS-CUTTING
Charter (why) → Roadmap (strategic what/when) → Epic (detailed what) → Story (how) → Delivery Plan (execution) → **Risk Registry** (risks)

This document is fed by ALL levels of the hierarchy:
- Charter §6 Constraints → initial strategic risks
- Roadmap §4 Dependencies → integration and external service risks
- Roadmap §5 Strategic Constraints → capacity, budget, deadline risks
- Epic §6 Risks & Edge Cases → feature-level risks
- Delivery Plan sprint transitions → trigger Risk Analysis Log entries (§2)
- Architect Agent's Deep Audit findings → may surface new risks

The Risk Registry is reviewed by the Team Lead at sprint boundaries and by the Architect Agent during Deep Audit reviews.

Do NOT output these instructions.
