FOLLOW THIS EXACT STRUCTURE. Output sections in order 1-4.

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Story ID, Parent Epic, Status, Ambiguity, Context Source, Actor, Complexity Label
2. **§1 The Spec**: Problem Statement or User Story + Detailed Requirements + Out of Scope
3. **§2 The Truth**: Gherkin acceptance criteria + verification steps
4. **§3 Implementation Guide**: Files to modify, technical logic, API contract
5. **§4 Quality Gates**: Minimum test expectations + Definition of Done checklist
6. **Token Usage**: Table auto-populated by agents — each agent appends their row via `count_tokens.mjs --self --append`

Ambiguity Score:
- 🔴 High: Requirements unclear
- 🟡 Medium: Logic clear, files TBD
- 🟢 Low: Ready for coding

Complexity Labels:
- **L1**: Trivial — Single file, <1hr vibe time, known pattern
- **L2**: Standard — 2-3 files, known pattern, ~2-4hr vibe time *(default)*
- **L3**: Complex — Cross-cutting, spike may be needed, ~1-2 days
- **L4**: Uncertain — Requires Probing/Spiking before Bounce, >2 days

Output the complexity as a single line: **Complexity: L{N}** — {brief description from above}. Do NOT output the full legend.

§1.1 Format:
- For user-facing stories, use: "As a {Persona}, I want to {Action}, So that {Benefit}."
- For infrastructure/framework stories, a direct problem statement is acceptable: "This story {does X} because {reason}."

§3.4 API Contract: Document EXISTING API contracts the implementation must comply with (current request/response shapes, auth requirements, rate limits). If this story creates a NEW API, describe the required contract. Remove this section entirely if no API changes.

Output location (Draft/Refinement): `product_plans/backlog/EPIC-{NNN}_{epic_name}/STORY-{EpicID}-{StoryID}-{StoryName}.md`

Sprint Lifecycle Rule:
- When a sprint starts, this Story file is MOVED to `product_plans/sprints/sprint-{XX}/`.
- When the sprint completes, this Story file is MOVED to `product_plans/archive/sprints/sprint-{XX}/`.

Document Hierarchy Position: LEVEL 4 (Charter → Roadmap → Epic → **Story**)

Upstream sources:
- §1 The Spec inherits from parent Epic §2 Scope Boundaries
- §3 Implementation Guide references Epic §4 Technical Context and Roadmap §3 ADRs
- Acceptance criteria (§2) refine Epic §7 Acceptance Criteria into per-story scenarios
- Complexity Label aligns with Delivery Plan story label definitions (L1-L4)

Downstream consumers:
- Developer Agent reads §1 The Spec and §3 Implementation Guide (with react-best-practices skill)
- QA Agent reads §2 The Truth to validate implementation (with vibe-code-review skill)
- Architect Agent reads full story context for Safe Zone compliance audit
- Sprint Plan §1 Active Scope tracks story V-Bounce state during the sprint
- Sprint Plan §1 Context Pack Readiness tracks per-story readiness using this template's sections

Agent handoff sections:
- §1 The Spec → Human contract (PM/BA writes, Dev reads)
- §2 The Truth → QA contract (BA writes, QA Agent executes)
- §3 Implementation Guide → AI-to-AI instructions (Architect writes, Dev Agent executes)

Do NOT output these instructions.

# STORY-{EpicID}-{StoryID}: {Story Name}

**Complexity: {L1/L2/L3/L4}** — {brief description}

---

## 1. The Spec (The Contract)
> Human-Readable Requirements. The "What".
> Target Audience: PM, BA, Stakeholders, Developer Agent.

### 1.1 User Story
> As a **{Persona}**,
> I want to **{Action}**,
> So that **{Benefit}**.

### 1.2 Detailed Requirements
- **Requirement 1**: {Specific behavior}
- **Requirement 2**: {Specific data or constraint}
- **Requirement 3**: {Expected state or outcome}

### 1.3 Out of Scope
- {What this story explicitly does NOT do}
- {Deferred to STORY-XXX or future work}

### TDD Red Phase: Yes / No
> "Yes" = Team Lead enforces Red-Green multi-pass. "No" = single-pass Developer spawn.
> Default: Yes for stories with Gherkin scenarios in §2. No for pure config/doc/template changes.

---

## 2. The Truth (Executable Tests)
> The QA Agent uses this to verify the work. If these don't pass, the Bounce failed.
> Target Audience: QA Agent (with vibe-code-review skill).

### 2.1 Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin/Pseudocode)
```gherkin
Feature: {Story Name}

  Scenario: {Happy Path}
    Given {precondition}
    When {user action}
    Then {system response}
    And {database state change}

  Scenario: {Edge Case / Error}
    Given {precondition}
    When {invalid action}
    Then {error message}
```

### 2.2 Verification Steps (Manual)
- [ ] {Story-specific manual checks — adapt to story type}
- [ ] {e.g., "Verify API returns 200 for valid input" or "Verify UI renders correctly on mobile"}

---

## 3. The Implementation Guide (AI-to-AI)
> Instructions for the Developer Agent. The "How".
> Target Audience: Developer Agent (with react-best-practices + lesson skills).

### 3.0 Environment Prerequisites
> Verify these before starting. Do NOT waste a bounce cycle on setup failures.

| Prerequisite | Value | Verified? |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Env Vars** | {e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`} | [ ] |
| **Services Running** | {e.g., "PostgreSQL on localhost:5432"} | [ ] |
| **Migrations** | {e.g., "Run `npx prisma migrate dev`"} | [ ] |
| **Seed Data** | {e.g., "Run `npm run seed`" or "None"} | [ ] |
| **Dependencies** | {e.g., "`npm install` after pulling latest"} | [ ] |

### 3.1 Test Implementation
- {Identify which test suites need to be created or modified to cover the Acceptance Criteria from §2.1}
- {Include E2E/acceptance tests — not just unit tests. Every Gherkin scenario in §2.1 must have a corresponding test}
- {e.g., "Create `AuthComponent.test.tsx` (unit) + `auth.e2e.test.ts` (acceptance)"}

### 3.2 Context & Files
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Primary File** | `{filepath/to/main/component.ts}` |
| **Related Files** | `{filepath/to/api/service.ts}`, `{filepath/to/types.ts}` |
| **New Files Needed** | Yes/No — `{Name of file}` |
| **ADR References** | ADR-{NNN} from Roadmap §3 |
| **First-Use Pattern** | Yes / No — {if Yes: name the pattern, e.g., "ARQ cron scheduling", "Supabase Realtime subscription"} |

> **First-Use Pattern guidance (Team Lead sets this):** Set to `Yes` when this story introduces a library, architectural pattern, or integration type with no prior example in the codebase. When `Yes`, the Developer Agent must search FLASHCARDS.md and the codebase for prior examples before writing any implementation code. If no examples exist, note it in the Implementation Report under "Discovery Notes" and add a flashcard after merge.

### 3.3 Technical Logic
- {Describe the logic flow, e.g., "Use the existing useAuth hook to check permissions."}
- {Describe state management, e.g., "Store the result in the global Zustand store."}

### 3.4 API Contract (If applicable)
> Document existing API contracts the implementation must comply with.
> If this story creates a new API, describe the required contract.
> Remove this section if no API changes.

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Request Shape | Response Shape |
|----------|--------|------|---------------|----------------|
| {`/api/resource`} | {GET/POST} | {Bearer/None} | {`{ id: string }`} | {`{ status: string }`} |

---

## 4. Quality Gates

### 4.1 Minimum Test Expectations
> Defined during sprint planning. Sets the minimum test bar for this story. QA validates against these.

| Test Type | Minimum Count | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Unit tests | {N} | {e.g., "1 per exported function"} |
| Component tests | {N} | {e.g., "render, interaction, edge case" — for UI stories} |
| E2E / acceptance tests | {N} | {e.g., "1 per Gherkin scenario in §2.1"} |
| Integration tests | {N} | {e.g., "1 per API endpoint" — for backend stories} |

> Guidelines: L1 stories ≥2 tests. L2 stories ≥5 tests. L3/L4 stories: planner defines based on scope.
> If "N/A" for a test type, write "0 — N/A (no {type} in scope)".

### 4.2 Definition of Done (The Gate)
- [ ] TDD enforced per story declaration. If "Yes": Red phase tests written and verified failing before Green phase. All Gherkin scenarios from §2.1 covered.
- [ ] Minimum test expectations (§4.1) met.
- [ ] FLASHCARDS.md + Sprint Context consulted before implementation.
- [ ] No violations of Roadmap ADRs.
- [ ] Environment prerequisites (§3.0) verified before starting.
- [ ] **Framework Integrity**: If `.claude/agents/`, `.vbounce/skills/`, `.vbounce/templates/`, or `.vbounce/scripts/` were modified, log to `.vbounce/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Token Usage
> Auto-populated by agents. Each agent runs `node .vbounce/scripts/count_tokens.mjs --self --append <this-file> --name <Agent>` before writing their report.

| Agent | Input | Output | Total |
