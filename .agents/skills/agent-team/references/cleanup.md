# Cleanup & Archive Rules

> On-demand reference from agent-team/SKILL.md. Read during sprint close or when archiving.

## After Each Story Completes (DevOps Step 5)

1. Archive all reports to `.vbounce/archive/S-{XX}/STORY-{ID}-{StoryName}/`
2. Merge story branch into sprint branch (--no-ff)
3. Validate tests/build on sprint branch
4. Remove worktree: `git worktree remove .worktrees/STORY-{ID}-{StoryName}`
5. Delete story branch: `git branch -d story/STORY-{ID}-{StoryName}`
6. Write DevOps Merge Report to `.vbounce/archive/S-{XX}/STORY-{ID}-{StoryName}/`

## After Sprint Completes (DevOps Step 7)

1. Merge sprint branch into main (--no-ff)
2. Tag release: `git tag -a v{VERSION}`
3. Run full validation (tests + build + lint)
4. Delete sprint branch: `git branch -d sprint/S-{XX}`
5. Verify `.worktrees/` is empty
6. Write Sprint Release Report to `.vbounce/archive/S-{XX}/sprint-S-{XX}-devops.md`
7. Lead archives Sprint Plan: `mv product_plans/sprints/sprint-{XX}/ product_plans/archive/sprints/sprint-{XX}/`
8. Lead archives sprint report: `mv .vbounce/sprint-report-S-{XX}.md .vbounce/archive/S-{XX}/`
9. Run: `vbounce trends && vbounce suggest S-{XX}` — generates improvement recommendations

## Retention Policy

| Location | Status | Rule |
|----------|--------|------|
| `.vbounce/archive/` | **Committed to git** | Permanent audit trail — never delete |
| `.vbounce/reports/` | **Gitignored** | Active working files only — ephemeral |
| `.vbounce/sprint-report-S-{XX}.md` | **Gitignored** | Active sprint report — archived on close |
| `.vbounce/sprint-context-*.md` | **Gitignored** | Regenerated each session |
| `.worktrees/` | **Gitignored** | Ephemeral — exists only during active bouncing |
| `product_plans/archive/` | **Committed** | Completed deliveries with all docs |

## After Delivery Completes (Team Lead)

1. Verify all stories in the release are "Done" in Roadmap §2 Release Plan
2. Add Delivery Log entry to Roadmap §7
3. Update Roadmap §2 Release Plan: status → "Delivered"
